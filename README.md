## Frontend-challenge

The goal was to list customers by their location with the given coordinates, and provide filters e an input to search a specific customer.

### Used libraries:

- ReactJS
- GraphQL
- Apollo (Client e Sever)
- Ant Design

### Project instructions

To start the client aplication execute insides client diretory: 

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

I made a simple BFF (Back-end for Front-end) server to wrap a rest api with GraphQL to make the client consume more easy and to handle all the logic of filters e search too. 

To start the server aplication execute insides server diretory: 

`npm install`

then

`node server.js`
